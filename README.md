  SUM(FeeTotal) AS TotalFees,
  SUM(DiscountTotal) AS TotalDiscounts,
  SUM(Total) AS TotalOrderAmount,

FROM
  dbo.CustomerOrder
GROUP BY
  StoreId
ORDER BY
  StoreId;

```

* MinSizeMB - integer

```sql
SELECT 
    t.name AS TableName,
    p.rows AS RecordCount,
    (a.total_pages * 8.0) / 1024 AS SizeMB
FROM 
    sys.tables t
INNER JOIN      
    sys.indexes i ON t.object_id = i.object_id
INNER JOIN 
    sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.object_id AND i.index_id = p.index_id
INNER JOIN 
    sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
WHERE 
    i.index_id <= 1 AND (a.total_pages * 8.0) / 1024 >= @MinSizeMB 

ORDER BY 
    SizeMB DESC;

```
